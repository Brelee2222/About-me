Hi, I am a 14 year old who likes to program in Js, Python, C++ and HTML.

I have made several programs, and one program that I made is a [Censor bot](https://top.gg/bot/806619458184806450)
I can solve a Rubik's cibe with an average of sub 30 secs.
I have a collection of 4 leaf clovers of 40+, 3 6 leafs (not cap), 4 5 leafs.
I have an [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/brelee2222006/), a [Discord](https://discord.com/users/479792413884547072) and other socials I am too lazy to put.
I am open to doing lots of things to my friend like abusing the power of javascript to crash people's computers, dising my friend for talking about the most -------- stuff about JSON files (some people are gonna see this from my censor bit page), and most importantly abusing my programming skills to play on my calculator during class and say that I'm not playing becuase I made the program so I know wha it does and winning 100% of the time when battling my friend mortal kombat style when he cant see that he's a skinny noodle.
